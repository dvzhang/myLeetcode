The GPT-3 is a technology that was created to recreate conversational language. Itâ€™s a neural network, which is a computer system that imitates how the human brain thinks and works. It produces grammatically correct sentences based on what people tell it. Over time, it changes the way it talks based on what it is told. For example, it started off speaking like a toddler, but now it is able to talk like an older child. The GPT-3 is also socially aware. It knows when to joke around and when to take it seriously, and it picks up on social cues like sarcasm, slang, and emojis. For these reasons, many researchers think that the GPT-3 is revolutionary because it is the closest that artificial intelligence has come to mimicking human communication.
